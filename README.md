# Welcome to my GitHub

Hi. My name is Travis. This is my GitHub. My work focuses mainly on control and learning in multi-agent robotics applications. I prefer Python for most things. 

My primary development project is the [multi-agent coordination simulator](https://github.com/tjards/multi-agent_sim), where I integrate various swarming techniques into a single environment for use in my academic research. You will see various offshoots where I play with new concepts, but they typically get intergated back into this project.
