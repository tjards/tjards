# Welcome to my GitHub

Hi. My name is Travis. This is my GitHub. My work focuses mainly on the application of reinforcement learning in control. I also do a bit of work in cybersecurity. I prefer Python for most things, but also have experience in Rust and MATLAB. I earned my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/) in 2018 and am now an adjunct professor (research) at the [Royal Military College of Canada](https://www.rmc-cmr.ca/en).


Main stuff I have on the go right now:
