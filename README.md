# Welcome to my GitHub

Hi. My name is Travis. This is my GitHub. My work focuses mainly on aerial robotics. I also do a bit of work in cybersecurity. I prefer Python for most things, but also have experience in a few other programming languages. I earned my [PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/handle/1974/24245) from [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/) in 2018 and am now an adjunct professor (research) at the [Royal Military College of Canada](https://www.rmc-cmr.ca/en).

What I'm working on now:

- [Network control using graph methods](https://github.com/tjards/pinning_swarming)
- [Investigation into swarming strategies](https://github.com/tjards/swarming_sim)
- [Learning a new programming language (Rust)](https://github.com/tjards/cracking_rust)
